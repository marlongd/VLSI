**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-4313):	Innovus cannot determine the drive strength of clk, which drives the root of clock_tree clk. To time this clock tree, Innovus will assume that it is driven by a driver cell with a fixed output slew of 0.000 and a maximum driven capacitance of 0.000. It is recommended that you set the source_driver property on this clock tree appropriately in order to correct this assumption.

Clock Tree Violations Report
============================

The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.


Max Capacitance Violations
--------------------------

Did not meet the max_capacitance constraint of 0.000pF below the root driver for clock_tree clk at (638.200,1414.400), in power domain auto-default, which drives a net clk which has internal don't touch reasons: {is_pad_net}. Achieved capacitance of 0.994pF.


**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-1361):	Routing configuration for top nets in clock tree clk: preferred layers METAL3-METAL4 are outside NanoRoute configured layer range. This is likely to cause routing correlation issues.
**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-1361):	Routing configuration for trunk nets in clock tree clk: preferred layers METAL4-METAL5 are outside NanoRoute configured layer range. This is likely to cause routing correlation issues.
**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-1361):	Routing configuration for leaf nets in clock tree clk: preferred layers METAL4-METAL5 are outside NanoRoute configured layer range. This is likely to cause routing correlation issues.
Primary reporting skew group is skew_group clk/constraint with 566 clock sinks.
